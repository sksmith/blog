I, like so many other programmers doubt myself a lot. In spite of years of experience successfully
solving problems and overcoming challenges, I still wonder about how I *really* measure up.

I think about my high school years playing Super Smash Bros Melee. In my home town, I was good. Ten
or so of us would get together and have a big tournament and I would typically either win, or come
in second to my brother. During this phase, I met a friend in school, Paul, who learned I liked
smash brothers and talked a lot of smack. We made plans to get together so we could see who was
actually better.

It wasn't even close.

I completely destroyed him. It felt great, having someone talk so much trash and then showing them
just how good you are. I'll never forget that feeling.

Well, a few years or two later, Paul and I would happen to go to the same college but we hung out
in different crowds. I still played it, but pretty casually. Enough that I probably didn't get much
worse, but certainly not trying to get any better. I remember Paul approaching me again and asking
if I wanted to play him. I remember gloating pretty hard, but Paul this time was pretty humble. So
a little later on during a big get together he and I had our chance to face off again.

It wasn't even close.

He completely trounced me. I think we were playing five stock, and I don't think I took a single
stock off of him. He was using moves I wasn't even aware of. He could beat me with any character on
the board.

I learned after that much that he had made a group of friends that took smash brothers pretty
seriously. They got together multiple times a week to practice and they closely followed the pro
scene.

There were a few lessons I took away from this. First, stay humble. It feels great to be the winner
whether or not you talked yourself up beforehand. But talking smack and losing has got to be one of
the worst feelings. The other (more relevant) point was that there are always bigger fish. Paul was
significantly better than me now. But he was still nowhere near the top. There were still people
that could make easy work of him *in his own group*.

I think about that a lot when it comes to programming. Whenever I do something I think is clever
and clear, I'm so quickly reminded about how the ocean of programmers out there is vast. I work
with programmers who are better than me. I consider that understanding an asset. But it can also be
a bit of a detriment.

I might not be the best programmer out there, or even a truly *great* programmer. But that doesn't
mean I don't have something to share. While people online can be cruel, and they frequently do know
more than I do, I still have something to offer, and it's important I remember that. That goes for
you too. Almost certainly you have experience in what you do that differs from what others have
experienced. That's an asset that anyone worth working with should be able to see. As long as you
are hard working, willing to learn, and polite, I really think programmers of all experience levels
can act as a boon to their teams and their local programming communities.

If you're uncomfortable with the idea of sharing something you've worked on, give it a try. You
know something worth teaching.
